# Machine Learning Learning Center

Welcome to the Machine Learning Learning Center! This repository is a hub for learning and exploring various machine learning concepts and algorithms.

## Overview

The aim of this center is to provide clear examples, code snippets, and Jupyter notebooks that explain and demonstrate machine learning concepts from the ground up. Whether you are starting with basic machine learning ideas or delving into advanced neural networks, this repository has something for you.

## Contents

- `cnn`: Notebooks and scripts related to Convolutional Neural Networks and their applications in image recognition.
- `perceptron`: Perceptron class with a perceptron.test file to showcase using matplotlib the training set
- `learningMl` : Jupyter notebooks to understand several ML concepts (Knn etc...)
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `MyNoteBook.ipynb`: An example notebook showcasing a machine learning application.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Machine-Learning-Learning-Center.git
```

Navigate into the project directory, and you can start exploring the notebooks:

```bash
cd Machine-Learning-Learning-Center
```

To run a Jupyter notebook, make sure you have Jupyter installed and run:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
TensorFlow or PyTorch (for neural network related content)
You can install these with pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

Or with conda if you are using Anaconda distribution:

```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```
